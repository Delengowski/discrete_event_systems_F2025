# Proposal

Zeng et al utilizes Petri Nets to devise a mechanism to optimize the use of emergency service resources across the entire emergerncy response chain from 911 operators, fire fighters, medics, and other first responders to hospitals and other downstream resources.

The paper provides a framework to compare various execution strategies for the emergency response chain and decides a clear winner by their metrics. My proposal is to come up a new resolution strategy in an attempt to beat their calculated maximum performance. To do this I will have to implement their algorithms in a language of my choice, validate their listed results then create an algorithm of my own in attempt to surpass their performance.
